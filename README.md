Selenium Automation Using TDD and BDD Approach


Hi Guys,

 This is just one POC script with complete automation framework using java, cucumber with BDD approach, in this i created
two feature files one for login with valid credentials and other for login with invalid credentials and two step Definitions file and one test runner class.

this script also generate one nice html report that is save in target folder,with screen shots. I also created few utility methods as well that we can reuse.
If you need anything please let me know on my email (sqt.rajeev@gmail.com).

Note: I can create same script using TDD approach and i know mobile automation using Appium,with Genymotion using android studio.

Thanks.
