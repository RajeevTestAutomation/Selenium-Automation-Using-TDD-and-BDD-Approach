Selenium Automation Using TDD and BDD Approach


Hi Guys,

 This is just one POC script with complete
automation framework using java, cucumber with BDD approach, in this i created
two feature files one for login with valid credentials.

 And other for login with invalid credentials
this script also generate one nice html report that is save in target folder
with screen shots. I also created few utility methods as well that we can reuse.
If you need anything please let me know on my email (sqt.rajeev@gmail.com)

Note: I can
create same script using TDD approach and i know mobile automation using Appium
with Genymotion using android studio.

Thanks.
